# portfolio-website
My very own first "real" simple project using html/css.


I've got some inspiration by simply googling "dark themed portfolio cv websites". 
Mainly reused and modified the underline after the h1 tag using :before and :after pseudo elements and the animated skill bars using @keyframes.

It also is somewhat responsive for mobile devices.
